# Ethereum boilerplate OSS

This repo is part of [fleekxyz/templates](https://github.com/fleekxyz/templates) a collection of Collection of Boileplates & examples configured to easily deploy to Fleek.xyz with the pre-configured scrips. End-to-end, from its contract to a Next.js frontend integrated to easily use the contract's ABIs.

- Find a deep-dive guide on this [article](https://blog.fleek.co/posts/ethereum-boilerplate-ipfs-nextjs).

Dapp Boilerplate that gives you maximum flexibility using oper-source packages, a non-binding stack, and tools giving you a fully customizable experience bootstraped with minimal configuration.

### Tech-Stack
- **[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/):** Development environment for Ethereum.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/):** Strongly typed lenguage that builds on JavaScript.
- **[wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/):** Collection on React Hooks for working with Ethereum.
- **[RainbowKit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/):** React library to add wallet connection to your Dapp.
- **[Typechain](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typechain):** Typescript bindings for Ethereum smart contracts.
- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/):** The React Framework.

### Quick start
To get started clone the `ethereum-dapp-oss`:

```
git clone https://github.com/fleekxyz/ethereum-boilerplate.git
```

Install all dependencies:

```
pnpm install
```

Start the project:

> This is a pre-configured script which runs a hardhat node, deploys it and starts the frontend.
> You can check the commands it triggers in `package.json`

```
nvm use v18
```

```
pnpm dev
```

Now you can interact with the frontend by going to [localhost:3000](https://localhost:3030)

### Available Scripts
- `hardhat:generate-abi`: Deploys contracts and exports the `API` & `address` to frontend. 
- `hardhat:clean`: Cleans the generated `artifacts` `cache` & `typechain-types` generated folders.
- `hardhat:deploy`: Deploys your contract to localhost & exports the `ABI` to the frontend.
- `hardhat:node`: Starts the Hardhat node.
- `frontend:dev`: Starts the NextJS frontend in development mode.
- `frontend:clean`: Cleans the generated folders inside the frontend application.
- `test`: Runs the tests for the smart contract.
- `clean`: Runs `frontend:clean` && `hardhat:clean`
- `dev`: Starts & deploys the hardhat node to the localhost & starts the frontend in development mode.

### How to customize
For customizing the project, please check the [customizing guide](customize.md).

#### Hardhat
- `contracts/`: This folder contains all of your contracts, it comes with example `Token.sol` to illustrate the experience.
- `deploys/`: Each file is meant to deploy a contract, you can check the `001_deploy_token.ts` for an example.

#### Frontend
- `frontend/`: Contains a minimal NextJS application prepared with `wagmi`, `rainbow kit` & `tailwind`
  - You can get started by customizing `frontend/src/pages/index.tsx`

## Deploying to Fleek

In order to deploy the Frontend, we'll use `Fleek CLI`, which allows us to deploy to IPFs from the `CLI`. If you haven't used Fleek CLI before, read the CLI section of [our docs](https://docs.fleek.xyz/getting-started/cli/).

You'll need to install the `CLI` as a global package by runnign the following command:

```
npm install -g @fleekxyz/cli
```

Then, move into the frontend project by running
```
cd frontend
```

and create a new Project:
```
fleek projects create
```

and then create a new site
```
fleek sites init
```

When you start the process, you will be prompted to create a new site or use an existing one. Go ahead and input a name for the site.

```
 > fleek sites init
 WARN! Fleek CLI is in beta phase, use it under your own responsibility
 ? Choose one of the existing sites or create a new one. › 
 ❯ Create a new site
```

Now that you have named the site, you’ll need to specify the output directory., Since we’re using NextJs, the output directory should be `out`:
```
 ✔ Choose one of the existing sites or create a new one. › Create a new site
 ✔ Type name of you new site. … fleek-demo-docs
 ✔ Specify the dist directory from where the site will be uploaded from > out
``` 

For the last step, choose to add a build command which will be `pnpm run build`

That's it! Your site is set up. You will see a file named fleek.json has been created in your directory, which holds the configuration to deploy the site.

You can now deploy your site to IPFS by running `fleek sites deploy`:
```
 > fleek sites deploy
 WARN! Fleek CLI is in beta phase, use it under your own responsibility
 > Success! Deployed! IPFS CID: QmQ88SAK9shZ7NUFTPJDcS9zuMmU7tDPbC9e9j5264Yfj4
```
